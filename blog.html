                        <p class="card-text"><b>Var: </b>Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are
                            issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for
                            new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we
                            discuss those issues.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text"><b>Let: </b>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise
                            as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that
                            we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
                        <p class="card-text"><b>Const: </b>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values.
                            const declarations share some similarities with let declarations. Like let declarations,
                            const declarations can only be accessed within the block they were declared.</p>

                                Function?</h5>
                            <p class="card-text"><b>Arrow Functin: </b>Arrow functions are a new way to write anonymous
                                function expressions, and are similar to lambda functions in some other programming
                                languages, such as Python. Arrow functions differ from traditional functions in a number
                                of ways, including the way their scope is determined and how their syntax is expressed.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text"><b>Regular Function: </b>Regular functions created using function
                                declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are
                                constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions
                                are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                                constructor functions.</p>

                                <p class="card-text"><b>map(): </b>JavaScript Map creates a new array, which contains
                                    the results from the iteration over the elements of the array and calls the provided
                                    function once for each element in order. It's an important data structure that has
                                    many essential uses.</p>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>forEach(): </b>The forEach method is also used to loop through
                                    arrays, but it uses a function differently than the classic "for loop". The forEach
                                    method passes a callback function for each element of an array together with the
                                    following parameters: Current Value (required) - The value of the current array
                                    element.</p>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>filter(): </b>Internally, the filter() method iterates over each
                                    element of the array and passes each element to the callback function. If the
                                    callback function returns true , it includes the element in the return array. The
                                    filter() method accepts two named arguments: a callback function and an optional
                                    object.</p>
                                <p class="card-text"><b>find(): </b>The find() method returns the value of the first
                                    element that passes a test. The find() method executes a function for each array
                                    element. The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text"><b>Template String: </b>Template strings are a powerful feature
                                        of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables
                                        and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older
                                        versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and
                                        contain dynamic elements. Besides, Template literals provide an easy way to
                                        interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is called string
                                        interpolation. Below are the most reasons to use Template Strings -
